**Nightdream**

Nightdream is an open-source desk clock and screensaver app, perfect for both day and night use. When your device is charging or in screensaver mode, it displays a practical digital clock that automatically adjusts its brightness: bright during the day, and dimmed to a minimum for comfortable night viewing. You can also manually adjust the brightness to your preference. Important information such as battery level, date, and new notifications are also displayed. In night mode, the display is as dark as possible; pure black is only achieved on AMOLED displays. The font size can be adjusted with a simple two-finger zoom gesture.

**Customizable Design**
The design can be extensively adapted to your needs. You can adjust colors and fonts, and even personalize analog watch faces. The size of the clock can also be changed using a two-finger zoom gesture.

**Screensaver (formerly Daydream)**
This app can be used as a screensaver (known as Daydream on older Android versions) from Android 4.2 and above. To automatically turn off the screen at night, you might need to ensure Daydreams are deactivated in your Android settings (e.g., "Settings > Display > Screensaver"). The clock will reactivate with sufficient light or when the ambient noise level in the room exceeds a certain threshold.

**Quick Alarms & Radio Feature**
Set a quick alarm with a swipe from the left edge of the screen. Alarms can be deleted by tapping the lower right corner. Additionally, Nightdream allows you to listen to your favorite internet radio stations and even use them as an alarm sound.

**Battery Status**
When your device is charging, the app provides an estimated time until the battery is fully charged.

**Notifications**
Nightdream can display notifications for missed phone calls, GMail, WhatsApp, and Twitter. To enable this, you will need to grant "Notification access" (often found under "Settings > Security") or "Accessibility" access (on older Android versions) to Nightdream in your device's settings.

**Weather Conditions**
Optionally, current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast can be displayed. Nightdream supports various open weather providers, including OpenWeatherMap, Bright Sky, and Met.no.

**Open Source & Donations**
Nightdream is completely free and open-source software. Its full source code is available for review and contribution. If you appreciate this project and wish to support its continued development, you can find donation options through the project's repository.

**Permissions Explained:**

*   `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE`: Allows the app to play radio and wake with a radio stream even when not in the foreground.
*   `android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS`: Allows the app to modify audio settings, such as silencing the device during night mode.
*   `android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO`: Used during night mode to reactivate the screen if a certain ambient noise level is detected. The app continuously records audio for this purpose but **does not store any audio data**.
*   `android.permission.WAKE_LOCK`: Permits the app to wake the device from sleep (e.g., to turn on the display) and keep it on.
*   `android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`: This permission is necessary to read background images from external storage.

**Device Administrator Permission (Optional):**
This app can optionally utilize the Device Administrator permission to lock the screen at runtime. This can be considered useful for certain use cases. Before uninstalling the app, this permission must be manually revoked in the system settings (often found under "Security" > "Device administrators").
