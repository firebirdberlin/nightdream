**Version 1.0**

**Effective on January 20, 2017**

This privacy statement describes how **Stefan Fruhner** (the author)
collects and uses the personal information you provide. It also describes the
choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how
you can access and update this information.

This privacy policy describes how the Android application **NightDream**
gathers and uses private information.

### Overview

The author is in the business of selling applications. Private information about
the users is kept privately and is never given away or sold to third parties without your consent.
Private information is deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the intention
of the application itself. It is only stored on the users' device so that the author
is never in the possession of private data.

### Collection and Use

The application collects the following personal information from you:

The application **may** collect the following personal information
from you:

    - Usage activity about how you interact with our application(s) and which areas
      of our application(s) you visited.
    - Device Information and IP address.

The application **may** use this information to:

    - Conduct research and analysis to improve the application
    - Inform you about other products of the author.
    - Inform you about policy changes.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the application does not transfer any private or
personal information from your device(s).

### Sharing Your Information

Your information will only be shared with third parties in the ways that are
described in this privacy statement.

Your personal information **may** be disclosed:

    - As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process.
    - When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our
      rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or
      respond to a government request.
    - If the application is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a
      portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice
      on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information,
      as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
    - To any other third party with your prior consent to do so.

### Third party services

The application makes use of third party services for services such as
application stability tracking and general application usage.
While the author makes every effort to only use services provided by trustworthy and
reputable third parties, The author can accept no responsibility for how these third
parties manage or share information and data in their possession.

### Third party links

The author may include or offer third party products or services within the
application. These third party sites have separate and independent
privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and
activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, I seek to protect the integrity of
our site and welcome any feedback about these sites. 

### Tracking, aggregated statistics and Ads

The author, or a third party contracted by the author, may use technologies to
gather information about how you and others interact with the application.
For example, it may be **aggregated** how many users access a specific
area within the application or make use of a specific feature.

The author may use this aggregated information to understand and optimize how the
application is used, improve his marketing efforts, and provide content and features
that are of interest to you.

NightDream may collect aggregated statistics about the behavior of users related
to the application itself.  The author may display this information publicly or
provide it to others. However, the author does not disclose personally identifying
information other than as described in this document.

The application will never show ads delivered by third parties.

### Security

The security of your personal information is important to me.
I follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information
submitted to me, both during transmission and once I receive it.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is
asolutely secure. Therefore, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### Other Information

The author may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to the
information practices. If any material changes are made the author will notify you by
by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective.
You are encouraged to periodically review this page for the latest information on the
privacy practices.
